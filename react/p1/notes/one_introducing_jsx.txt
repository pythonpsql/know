How to start a React project?
  1. mkdir p1
  2. create-react-app one
  3. cd one
  4. yarn upgrade --latest react-scripts
      current purpose was to use CSS modules

What is JSX? 
  React does not require using JSX
  It helps as a visual aid when working with UI inside js
  Allows React to show more useful erros and warnings
  Rendering logic is inherently coupled
    with other UI logic: 
      how events are handled,
      how the state changes over time,
      and how the data is prepared for display.
  Instead of separating technologies:
    markup (like HTML) and logic (like js),
    React separates concerns with components that
      contain both markup and logic
  For convention, 
    one may rename files containing jsx code
    with .jsx extension
  JSX can contain
    any valid js expression inside curly braces
      An expression is any valid unit of code that
      resolves to a value.
  If JSX code is split into multiple lines, 
    use paranthesis
  JSX is also an expression
    On compilation, they become js function calls
      and evaluate to js objects
    This means, JSX can be 
      used inside 
        if statements,
        for loops
      assigned to 
        variables
      accepted as
        arguments
      returned from
        functions
  Attributes can be specified using:
    curly braces to enclose js expression
    quotes to specify string literals 
      string literals means 
        string constant,
        not string variable like string object
  ReactDOM uses camelCase property naming convention
  JSX tags may contain children
    If no children, then close tag with '/>'
  Prevents injection attacks
    ReactDOM escapes any values embedded in JSX
      Everything is converted to a string
  JSX represents objects
    Babel compiles JSX to React.createElement() calls
    These objects are called React elements
    React reads these objects and uses them 
      to construct the DOM and update it
  Example:
    JSX
      const element = (
        <h1 className="greeting">
          Hello, world!
        </h1>
        );

    Babel compilation:
      const element = React.createElement(
        'h1',
        {className: 'greeting'},
        'Hello, world!'
        );

    Simpified structure of object created by createElement:
      // Note: this structure is simplified
      const element = {
        type: 'h1',
        props: {
          className: 'greeting',
          children: 'Hello, world!'
        }
      };
  For correct syntax highlighting of ES6 and JSX,
    Babel language definition must be used by editor
