What are components?
  js functions
  accept inputs (called 'props' as a convention)
  return React elements

How to create components?
  one way is to create a function
    accept single arguments (props)
    return a React element
  second way is to create a class

How to render a component?
  elements can render user-defined components
  e.g.
    const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;

  <Welcome> is a user-defined component

  When React sees an element representing
  a user-defined component, 
  it passes JSX attributes to this component
  as a single object. 
  We call this object 'props'
  All JSX attributes are passed as props
  The JSX attribute 'name' is retrieved by 
    using props.name
  Component names must begin with uppercase letter  
    lowercase are treated as html tags

Composing components
  Components can refer to 
    other components in their output

Extracting components
  Split a component into smaller components
    for code re-use
  Props should be named from the 
    point of view of the component
    and not the context in which it is being used

When to create a new component?
  If part of UI is reusable
  or if it is complex enough on its own
  
All React components must act like
  pure functions with respect to their props
  (i.e. don't modify props inside the component)
